# Comparison with ECLAIR [(Giecold *et al.*, Nucl. Acids
  Research, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw452)

The results can be reproduced by following the steps in [*logfile_run_X_krumsiek11_scaled.txt*](logfile_run_X_krumsiek11_scaled.txt), which also stores the logging output. Scaling the data matrix and choice parameters are based on a discussion with G. Giecold, reproduced here https://github.com/GGiecold/ECLAIR/issues/3.

The algorithm could not handle the unnormalized data matrices *X_krumsiek11_blobs.txt* and *X_krumsiek11.txt*.
